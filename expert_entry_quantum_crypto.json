  "question": "What are the primary challenges in adopting post-quantum cryptography standards like CRYSTALS-Kyber in existing internet infrastructure?",
  "answer": "The migration poses several challenges. Firstly, performance overhead: PQC algorithms can introduce 15-40% higher latency for TLS handshakes, impacting user experience. Secondly, cryptographic agility: legacy systems and hardware security modules (HSMs) often lack the flexibility to be updated with new algorithms. Thirdly, interoperability: ensuring all parties in a communication channel support the same PQC standard is a complex coordination problem. Finally, there's the challenge of the transition period, where hybrid solutions (e.g., RSA + Kyber) must be run, increasing complexity. The NIST IR 8413 guidelines and the NSA's CNSA 2.0 suite provide a roadmap, but implementation remains a multi-year effort for large organizations."
